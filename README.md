# Text_Editor

Welcome to the Text_Editor by Altintzis Lazaros Alexandros

It's a Command Prompt based notepad, only working on Windows for the momment, which has the basic features of making files with whatever extesion the user wants, deleting files, reseting a file (deleting it's content without deleting the file), listing files and directories and much more.
It's an early version of what I want this app to become, as it is obvious from the name, and I'm working on it consistantly to improve the expierence of it's user. So any feedback would be really appreciated.
Expect a lot of updates on this README.md and enjoy hope you enjoy the app!
